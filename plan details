Talked about things that are important, and some things we can incorporate into the house.

important things:
    Good ventalation in the bathroom. maybe thru a strong fan, or a window in the bathroom.

incorporate things:
    a dormer or a nook on the main level.  maybe like a comfy spot to hang out and look out
of the window.  Maybe we could hide a staircase (that doubles as storage) inside of the closet.
that staircase would lead to the dormer in the loft.
